# nxopen\_rs

A Rust binding for Siemens NX Open API, enabling developers to build NX CAD automation tools with Rust's safety and performance.

## Overview

`nxopen_rs` provides a type-safe Rust interface to interact with NX Open, Siemens' API for automating NX CAD/CAE processes. This library wraps core NX functionalities (e.g., part operations, dialogs, geometry) and leverages Rust's memory safety features to avoid common pitfalls like resource leaks or invalid pointer access.
